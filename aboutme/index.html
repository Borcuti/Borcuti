    <h2>David Borcuti</h2>
    <p>My name is David Borcuti and I am from Romania and I am currently live in Satu Mare, Romania. I work in finance for now but I will change my job from 
        November and I will work for the Church as a Travel Coordinator and I need to move to Germany. I have a business degree and I would love to continue my studies with IT.
        Hope one day to be an entrepreneur and I believe the IT skills will help me to be a great one.

        I am 27 years-old, single guy and I love hiking and sports in general. I am a convert to the church for almost 6 years. I have met the missionaries in Denmark as I was a student and
        and I joined the church soon after. I also went on a mission to the Frankfurt Germany Mission.
